# ATARI ACSI Hard Drive Controller Emulator
Use your ageing ATARI ST again!
KISS principal implemented throughout!
This has been done before. I don't pretend to have invented this. However, this design uses the Raspberry PI PICO, which, at time of designing, had not been done before.
This is in know way the finished article. I have uploaded to git simply because there is some interest, and who knows? maybe others will conribute to make a "complete" package.

### Initial Release:
Note the shell... you can do things whilst the emulator is doing its stuff.
At the moment, there isn't much. Just date, time reporting. But partition dumps could be performed, partitioning and formatting sd cards as examples.
